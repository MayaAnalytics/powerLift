# powerLift
New Package I created that Computes Powerlifitng Metrics. Powerlifting is being more popular around the globe. However, many lifters, especially in the U.S. only have access to weights measured in pounds (lbs.). This
package allows coaches and lifters to upload their team or individual data. It then
assists in converting lifts to kilograms, calculating total weight lifted, one rep
max based on past weight and reps, protein goal as suggested by the NIH, and creates
a visualization comparing the three main lifts, squat, bench, and deadlift.
